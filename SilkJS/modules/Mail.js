/**
 * @class Mail
 * 
 * ### Synopsis
 *
 * var Mail = require('Mail').Mail;
 * var message = new Mail();
 *
 * Interface for sending email messages from SilkJS programs.
 *
 * This class provides support for encoding and sending multipart email messages.  You can use this class to send HTML email, email with attachments, etc.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```
 * var message = new Mail();
 * message.setFrom(from);
 * message.addTo(to);
 * message.setSubject(subject);
 * message.setHtml('&lt;h1>Test Message&lt;/h1>');
 * message.addAttachment('foo', 'text/plain', fs.readFile64('/tmp/foo'));
 * message.send();
 * ```
 *
 * ### NOTE
 *
 * This class relies on the command-line sendmail program.
 *
 * It is located in /usr/sbin/sendmail on OSX, but must be installed on Linux using your package management software (e.g. apt, yum, rpm, etc.)
 *

     * For a plain text message, you will only need to set the text part.   Or if you do not set an HTML part, the recipient will see the plain text version, but will also be able to manage any attachments you add to the message.
     *
     * See Message.setHtml() for a method to set the HTML part, and Message.addAttachment() for adding attachment parts.
